      I'm currently a Computer Science undergraduate at the
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://uspf.edu.ph/" target="_blank">University of Southern Philippines Foundation</a>.
      I have a passion for developing cutting-edge solutions for a variety of platforms, including web, mobile, and software applications.
      I started my journey in this field back in 2014 when I discovered XHTML on my GPRS keypad mobile phone, and since then,
      I have honed my skills by developing a diverse range of applications on my own time and through freelance work.

      As someone who's ultimate goal is to establish a career as a software engineer, I am well-versed in multiple programming languages
      and am always eager to expand my knowledge as an experienced full stack developer â€”
      combining the power of code and design to bring ideas to life.

      <strong>When I'm off the grid from my coding space</strong>, I am probably immersing myself in the world of gaming, writing,
      or just watching Korean and Chinese drama.
